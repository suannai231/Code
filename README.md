Developed a machine learning system for stock price prediction and generation of trading strategies. This project leverages Python and machine learning libraries to analyze market data, build predictive models, and recommend data-driven trading decisions.

Technical Skills

•	Programming Languages: Python

•	Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch

•	Data Analysis Libraries: Pandas, NumPy

Project Description

•	Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: Built a data pipeline to ingest historical and real-time stock data from an API like Yahoo Finance. Utilized Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning, manipulation, and feature engineering.

•	Feature Engineering: Extracted and generated new technical indicators from existing data to enhance the predictive power of machine learning models.

•	Machine Learning Modeling: Employed deep learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to analyze historical and real-time data and predict future price movements.

•	Trading Strategy Development: Implemented a trading strategy service that utilizes model predictions to identify potential buy and sell signals, enabling data-driven trading decisions.
